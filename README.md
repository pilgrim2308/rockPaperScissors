# rockPaperScissors
A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game
This was my first project using HTML,CSS and Vanilla Javascript.
It contains a basic rockPaperScissors game.
Functionality includes displaying the user's choice and the computer's choice, along with the result of each match.
It also keeps score, and declares the first to reach 3 points as the winner.
